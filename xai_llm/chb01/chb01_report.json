  "summary": "The EEG spectrogram analysis suggests seizure activity is present with high confidence. The model indicates a seizure event within the observed timeframe, with a confidence of approximately 99.97%.",
  "xai_explanation": "The Grad-CAM visualization highlights areas of the spectrogram that most influenced the model's prediction. Approximately 1.3% of the spectrogram was highlighted. The strongest activation was observed near time column 47 and frequency row 56, indicating that these specific time-frequency components were particularly salient for seizure detection.",
